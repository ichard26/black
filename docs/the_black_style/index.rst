The Black Code Style
====================

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    Current Style <current_style>
    Future Style <future_style>

*Black* is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter with its own style.

.. note::

  While keeping the style unchanged throughout releases is a goal, The *Black* Code  
  Style isn't set in stone. Sometimes it's modified in response to user feedback or 
  even changes of the Python language!

Documentation for both the current and future styles can be found:

- :doc:`current_style`
- :doc:`future_style`
